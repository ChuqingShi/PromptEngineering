The plush is incredibly soft and cute, making it the perfect companion for my daughter wherever she goes. However, I did notice a slight asymmetry in the ears, which I believe was not intentional. Additionally, considering the price, I found the size to be a bit smaller than expected. I believe there are larger options available for the same cost. Despite this, the plush arrived a day earlier than anticipated, allowing me to enjoy it myself before gifting it to my daughter. Overall, while there are minor flaws, the quality and early delivery make this panda plush a worthwhile purchase."
