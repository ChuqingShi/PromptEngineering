# ChatGPT Engineering for Developers

This repository contains my exercise code in Jupyter notebook, based on the short online course ['ChatGPT Engineering for Developers'](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/chatgpt-prompt-eng/lesson/dfbds/introduction).

Make sure a `.env` file with a valid private OpenAI API key ("OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...") is present in the current directory for the code to work.

## Content:
* Fundamentals of prompt engineering [(2)](2-Guidelines.ipynb).
* Effective prompting [(3)](3-Iterative.ipynb), and how to use LLMs for summarizing, inferring, transforming, and expanding [(4567)](4567-CommonUseCases.ipynb).
* Building a Chat Bot based on LLM [(8)](8-ChatBot.ipynb).
